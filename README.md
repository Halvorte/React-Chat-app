# React messaging app
Chat app made in react.js

Made this project to practice Javascript.

Inspired by and used Fireship.io's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQyrwxMPm88)
The CSS code is copied from this [repository](https://github.com/fireship-io/react-firebase-chat), but i will change it and make it my own later.

It uses firebase for login and database. 

## Faults with the app / to improve

A problem with the app at the moment is that there is a max number of messages it can show.

Make my own CSS
